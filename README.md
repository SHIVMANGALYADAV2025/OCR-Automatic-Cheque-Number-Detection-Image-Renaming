# OCR-Automatic-Cheque-Number-Detection-Image-Renaming
In my Office Admin Team Face issue regarding check manually rename as per cheque number so create this project just for there help that check automatic rename as per cheque number


Project Title:

OCR â€“ Automatic Cheque Number Detection and Image Renaming

Department / Client:

Office Administration & Accounts Team

Business Problem:

Our admin and accounts teams handle multiple cheque images daily as part of financial record management. Each image must be manually checked and renamed according to its cheque number before storage or audit submission.
This manual process is time-consuming, prone to human error, and difficult to track when processing large volumes of cheque images.

Business Solution:

To overcome this challenge, an automated OCR-based system was developed to detect cheque numbers from scanned cheque images and rename the image files automatically.
Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Python and OpenCV, the system extracts the cheque number directly from the image. The extracted number is then used to rename the image file, ensuring consistent file naming and easy traceability.
This automation significantly reduces manual workload and enhances operational efficiency for the admin and accounts teams.

Technology Stack:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, pytesseract, os, shutil

OCR Engine: Tesseract OCR

IDE: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Deployment Tool: Streamlit (for simple user interface)

Business Benefits:

Automates cheque number extraction and image renaming.

Reduces manual effort and eliminates file-naming errors.

Saves up to 70% of processing time for cheque documentation.

Ensures better organization and faster retrieval of cheque records.

Provides a scalable solution for future automation tasks in the admin team.
